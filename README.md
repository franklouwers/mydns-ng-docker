mydns-ng was an authoritative DNS server that used a MySQL backend. It was once fairly popular,
but the latest release dates from 2010.

Only use this Docker image to simulate existing environments that need to be upgraded to a more recent
and more modern DNS server such as PowerDNS, Bind or unbound.
